A basic react setup inspired by [this](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/).

Will be updated as my react needs change, just wanted to start moving away from create-react-app

## Usage

### Install packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Run test server

```bash
npm start
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Results in a build in the dist/ folder
